This plugin is only available if 'compatible' is not set, and your vim has
been compiled with |+cursorshape| support.

INTRODUCTION                                                    *togglecursor*

In gVim, when you change from normal mode to insert mode, the cursor shape
typically changes from a block cursor to a line ('|') cursor.  However, in a
terminal, you loose that feature.  This plugin aims to help bring it back on
supported terminals.

==============================================================================
SUPPORTED TERMINALS                                   *togglecursor-supported*

Currently supported terminals are iTerm2 for the Mac and KDE's Konsole.  The
xterm console is partially supported as well.  Older xterm's didn't support
the line cursor, so this plugin currently sets the cursor to underline
instead.

The gnome-terminal application doesn't support changing the cursor via escape
sequences and is not supported.  On unsupported terminals, Vim's default
behavior is left unaltered.

==============================================================================
LIMITATIONS                                         *togglecursor-limitations*

Since this plugin relies on detecting on the type of terminal being run, it
will not work automatically when working remotely.  The required environment
variables are simply not available.

This also doesn't support all terminals.  Currently, only iTerm2 for the Mac,
and Konsole under Linux are supported.  Others may be added later, as long as
there is a safe way to detect and add that support.

Also, this plugin works by setting the |t_SI| and |t_EI| options, so there
are some limits as to what it can do.  For instance, assume your default
cursor type in the terminal is to have an underline cursor When Vim will
exits, it will leave the cursor in block mode (due to the |t_EI| setting) and
effectively clobber your terminal's configuration.  Unfortunately, there's no
way to store the current cursor settings from a terminal, and therefore, no
way to restore the original state.
